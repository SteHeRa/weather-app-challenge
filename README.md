# Weather app

You're asked to create a web application using React which allows its users to see the date, time, temperature and humidity for one or more city's of their choosing.

The application should remember the cities the users choose so that if they refresh or navigate away and back they can still see them. You can use any weather data source you find appropriate. Please describe how you would go about creating this.
